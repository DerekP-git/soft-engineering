                The residents of Renaissance hall are rejoicing over the fact that, in a few days, a tennis court will adorn their grounds. The court is to be situated in the northwest corner of the yard and will be surrounded on three sides by the beautiful pine hedge which makes these grounds the most artistic site for a tennis court.

            <p>1921: New Tennis Court -
                The third court is to the west of the other courts and has been ready for play for several years as far as the fence being up was concerned, but until this fall the weeds have never been cleaned off of the plot and the rectangle rolled or put into shape.
