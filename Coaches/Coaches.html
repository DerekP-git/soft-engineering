            <h3>Alex Struck</h3>
            <p>Head Coach.</p>
                <p>Alex Struck was named Morningside University head men's and women's tennis coach in June 2021.

                Struck is entering his fourth season at the helm of both the men's and women's tennis programs. Both squads are coming off historic seasons in 2023-2024. The men won both the regular season GPAC Championship and GPAC Tournament for the first time in program history. The women won both the regular season GPAC Championship and GPAC Tournament for the fourth time in program history. Each team qualified for the NAIA National Tournament. Additionally, both teams were rated top 25 by the ITA for the first time in program history (17 for the men and 21 for the women). Lastly, the men and women set new school records for most team wins in a year, with 18 wins for each team in 2023-2024. 
                
                Under Struck's leadership, the Mustangs picked up the program's first NAIA All-Americans in both men's and women's history during the 2023-2024 campaign. Other significant honors earned include Men's GPAC Player of the Year, Men's ITA NAIA Rookie of the Year Central Region, and Women's ITA NAIA Rookie of the Year Central Region. Struck also was recognized as the Women's ITA NAIA Wilson Coach of the Year Central Region in 2023-2024. 
                
                Struck was named GPAC Women's Tennis Coach of the Year in 2022-2023 and 2023-2024. He was named GPAC Men's Tennis Coach of the Year in 2023-2024. The women reached the GPAC Championship in each of his first two years and the men made the GPAC Championship in his second year. Struck has coached 12 men who have earned 27 all-conference honors in singles and doubles and 12 women who have earned 34 all-conference honors in singles and doubles. 
                
                The Mustangs have been quite studious during Struck's tenure, boasting 21 Intercollegiate Tennis Association Scholar-Awards for the men and 29 for the women. In addition, both the men's and women's teams were named ITA All-Academic Teams in 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024. Furthermore, six men and six women have been named to the College Sports Communicators Academic All-District Team highlighted by three being named CSC All-Americans. Additionally, 10 men and 13 women have garnered honors as NAIA Daktronics Scholar Athletes. 
                
                He is no stranger to the Mustang family, as he was a four-year team member and captain as an undergraduate, part of a playing resume in which he also held the single-season victory record at one point. Struck earned All-Great Plains Athletic Conference honors in 2013 and 2015 along with gaining two Daktronics National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics' Scholar-Athlete awards and a Collegiate Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) college division academic at-large selection.
                
                Before returning to Morningside, Struck was a teacher and coached multiple sports at Le Mars Community Schools. He was the head boy's tennis coach at Le Mars High School in 2021. The Bulldogs experienced impressive successes under his tutelage. They went 12-2 and advanced to the Iowa High School Athletic Association Class 1A State Tournament.</p>

            <h3>Larry Mason</h3>
            <p>Assistant Coach.</p>
                <p>Larry "Mace" Mason, a 1973 graduate of Morningside and one of the most successful players in the history of the university's tennis program, moves into a new role as an assistant coach for the men's and women's programs. Mason had been the head coach of both teams from 2008-17 and other points during his coaching career.

                He sported a 98-69 career record in 10 seasons as the Mustangs' head women's tennis coach. Mason led the Mustangs to six consecutive winning seasons, including a 53-17 record for a .757 winning percentage over his last four campaigns.
                
                Mason guided the Mustangs' men's and women's teams to record-breaking success in the 2016-17 season when the men posted a 14-9 record and the women finished 15-4 to set school records for victories in a season. He was named the 2016 Hauff Mid-America Sports/GPAC Women's Tennis Coach of the Year after he guided the Mustangs to one of their greatest seasons in school history. Morningside posted a 13-3 record to set a school record with a .813 winning percentage and won GPAC regular season and post-season tournament championships en route to its second appearance in the NAIA Women's Tennis National Championship in a three-year stretch.
                
                Mason was also named the 2014 GPAC Women's Tennis Coach of the Year when the Mustangs had a 12-5 record and won their first-ever GPAC regular season and post-season tournament championshps to qualify for the NAIA National Tournament for the first time in school history.
                
                Mason led the Mustangs to new heights during the 2011-12 season when both the men's and women's teams reached the championship round of the GPAC's post-season tournament for the first time in school history. Mason was named the 2012 GPAC Women's Tennis Coach of the Year after he led the Mustangs to a 14-7 record and a runner-up finish in the GPAC regular season standings.
                
                Mason played No. 1 singles all four years of his Morningside career. He compiled a 32-16 record in singles to set a school record for singled victories. Mason had a 27-18 record in doubles and 59 combined victories to set school records in both categories. He posted singles records of 9-4 as a junior and 9-5 as a senior. Mason and Russ McComsey teamed up for an 11-2 doubles record in 1973 to set a school record for doubles victories in a season.
                
                After his graduation, Mason was the head tennis coach at Morningside for 1974, 1975, and 1976 seasons. He became head boy's tennis coach at Sioux City North High School in 1977. Over the next 21 years he guided the Stars to a 192-58 record in dual meets. His teams won 19 city championships and nine conference championships. He coached 69 state meet qualifiers and 18 state meet place winners, including former Mustang coach Mike Inman, who became Sioux City's first state singles champion in 1979. In state team competition, Mason guided North to 13 substate berths, four appearances in the state semifinals, and to a state runner-up finish in 1993. He had a 20-8 record in three seasons as North's head girl's tennis coach.
                
                In 1999, he was certified as Professional 1 (the highest certification) by the United States Professional Tennis Association. Mason also received the M-Club Coach of the Year award in 1979 and was inducted into the M-Club Hall of Fame in 1983. He played his high school tennis at Sioux City Central, where his coach was M-Club Hall of Famer Herrold Asmussen.</p>

            <p>Al Buckingham, a 1939 graduate of Morningside, returned to his alma mater following his service in the United States Navy to become a key figure in the college's athletic programs. Upon his discharge on November 7, he joined the Physical Education Department and assumed duties as the men's basketball coach, where he quickly built a strong won-lost record with the Maroon squad.

                Buckingham transitioned to tennis in 1948 and led one of the finest teams in Morningside history. Under his guidance, the Mustangs' 1948 tennis team achieved remarkable success.
                
                Before his return to Morningside, Buckingham coached at Sergeant Bluff High School for two years, leading his basketball team to a state tournament appearance, an early indicator of his coaching ability and leadership skills.

While pursuing his doctoral studies at Duke, he also served as assistant pastor for a large Methodist church in Durham, North Carolina, between 1953 and 1957.

Under his guidance, Morningside tennis benefitted from a growing enthusiasm for the sport, supported by the addition of new courts adjacent to campus. Benjamin encouraged all students to embrace tennis as a lifetime sport, reflecting his own philosophy that "tennis is a sport which seems to 'grow' on you the more you play it."
                
                Known for his congeniality and commitment to both academics and athletics, Dr. Benjamin left a lasting impact on the Morningside community, balancing his dual roles as a respected religious scholar and an inspiring athletic coach.</p>
